## Comparing Landscapes:  Deep Neural Networks versus Glassy Systems

**SUPERVISOR**: C. Cammarota

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**: 

The training process of a deep neural network (DNN) shares strong similarities with the physical dynamics of disordered systems: the  loss  function  plays  the  role  of  the  energy,  the  weights  are  the  degrees  of  freedom,  and  the dataset corresponds to the parameters defining the energy function. This project is aimed at studing this similarity by using toy models of DNN along  the  lines  traced  in  [1]. The  plan is to  use  a  toy  dynamics  as  close  as  possible  to  the physical dynamics of disordered systems, for the training of DNN to reveal the similarities between the landscape of loss functions of DNNs and the one of the energy of paradigmatic disordered systems.

**PREREQUISITES**: 

Numerical skills in any programming language, Path integrals, Langevin dynamics
